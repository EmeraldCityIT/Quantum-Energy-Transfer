# Quantum-Energy-Transfer
This project looks at a novel method for transfering energy as photons of light from a crystal growth structure, through chemical bonds into physically detached "broken off" crystal shards. As physical changes do not effect chemistry of a substance, a piece of crystal is still chemically bonded to the crystal growth from which it was broken. Using experiments with transfer of energy using light frequency, this project hopes to investigate power sources implanted in crystal growths and will attempt to transfer energy into fragments physically removed "broken" (Physical Change vs Chemical Change) from the main structure.
